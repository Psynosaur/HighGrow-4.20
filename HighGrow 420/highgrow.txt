objectives
----------
1.  to grow 3 marijuana seeds within 8 months
	germination after 3 (registered) or 10 (shareware) days
	seedling stage for 4 to 6 weeks
	vegetative stage in 3 to 6 months
	preflowering for 2 to 3 weeks
	flowering from 4 to 6 weeks

2.  to produce big plants with many strong branches you need,
	light on maximum before flowering
	watered an average of 3 days per week, not too much at seedling stage
	soil not over fertilised
	pruned at start of vegetative stage and not to often afterwards
	good humidity if close to light

3.  to create an environment ideal for maximum potency maintain,
	lighting close but not touching plants
	correct watering, but slow down at flowering
	regular fertilising but not too much to destroy PH balance
	do not prune after preflowering
	
4.  to prevent the plants from dying
	don't let the lights touch the plant
	water between 1 and 3 times per week
	don't fertilise more than once a week
	don't prune too much
	register the program


program objective
-----------------
the user should name his 3 plants when he plants the seeds
their sex is only decided at preflowering with a 30% chance of being male
the user should visit every day for extra growth
we'll calculate growth since last visit each time before he views his plants
he enters the daily(?) activities for each plant on a dialog
each day, we'll give the user a tip on each activity (stringtable entries)
we'll record each day's activities and calculate the general health of each plant
using this health factor, we'll add or remove nodes from each plant
each node of each plant is recorded and can be adjusted by health factors
the entire growing progress is viewable in chart form
everything is stored in a file which is checksummed to prevent tampering


the plant structure
-------------------
for each plant we'll hold

	char    szName[50]      // user may enter this when he plants his seed
	int     iGrowthStage    // seedling, vegetative, flowering etc.
	BOOL    bFemale         // may be true only after three months
	int     iTHC            // current potency of plant (based on ideal health)
	int     iMass           // current weight of wet plant in grams
	int     iClipMass       // total weight of clipped plant material in grams


the health structure
--------------------
for each day of the year in each plant, we record

	int     iLightDuration  // half hours per day of light
	int     iLightIntensity	// mm away of light from last pNodeEnd
	BOOL    bWatered        // ideal at 3 times per week
	int     iWaterAmount    // ideal at 1000 ml per plant
	BOOL    bFertilised     // ideal at once a week
	int     iNPKmix         // 0-255 for each in RGB coloref type struct
	BOOL    bPruned         // if yes, growth stopped for four days before splitting
	BOOL    bRegistered     // untill true, growth at half speed

When the user adjusts the "factors" dialog we fill these elements (for the current day 
and for the few days since he last started the program) and then calculate the 
general health of the plant, which we will store in the "conditions" struct variable.

	int     iHealth         // is used to apply the new day's growth

This health value is used when each node is redrawn rather than recalculating it for each
day in the plant's life before drawing.


the iHealth factor
------------------
There are four stages of growth, based on the health factor

	0  to 20  and the plant is dying
	20 to 30  and the plant is barely surviving
	30 to 60  and the plant is healthy
	60 to 100 and the plant is thriving

to calculate this value, we use the previous day's value and add or subtract from it
based on the calculated "conditions" struct variables,

more health for long photoperiod and lose it if long photoperiod after flowering starts
more health if light is at ideal height from plant, less if further away and none if off
etc, etc, etc.....

once we've calculated the health of the plant we'll create a few more node structures in
our array of exisitng nodes (saved in our file).


the node structure
------------------
for each node in each plant we record,

	POINT   ptNodeStart      // X and Y of start of node
	POINT   ptNodeEnd        // X and Y of end of node
	BOOL    bGrowingTip      // true if this is a growing tip
	int     iStemThickness   // between 1 and 5 pixels thick
	int     iNumLeaves       // 0 to 4 leaves per node (always at top)
	int     iLeafType        // small or big, or dead, or buds at different stages

before allowing the user to view the condition of his plants, we first check the condition
of his plants based on his last visit (dead or alive) and we may then alter the
iNumLeaves and iLeafType elements for each node.


adding new nodes
----------------
each day in the plant's life some nodes are added to our plant
first natural node split at start of vegetative stage and twice after (shareware?)
each time he prunes a growing tip, 3-4 days must elapse before node splits and grows again
each plant has a variable number of growing tips, based on pruning regularity
a new node is added to most growing tips on each day (based on day last pruned)
healthy plants have nodes which are created longer, but unhealthy plants have short nodes


adding new leaves
-----------------
the condition of leaves and stem thickness is also determined by health
each day has some leaves added to some existing nodes and some falling off
leaves are exchanged for growing male or female flower clusters after preflowering
we have four leaf sets for each of the health stages (dead, surviving, healthy, thriving)
