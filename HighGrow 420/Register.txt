Why you should register HighGrow:
---------------------------------

Although the shareware version is fully functional and completely realistic, 
it does have one very serious limitation:


	Each of your plants will stop growing after one hundred days!


This however, should be ample time to evaluate and register this program 
and by doing so, save your plants from an untimely death.

Shareware versions of this program can be registered for only $20. 
As soon as your registration letter is received in the snail-mail, you will 
be emailed a unique code, enabling immediate registration of this version.


To register a shareware version of HighGrow, please perform the following 
steps:

1.	Click on the Print button to make a paper copy of this page.
